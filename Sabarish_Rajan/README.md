# Insurance Fraud Detection

This project deals with building a Machine Learning model that detects if an Insurance claim is fraud or not. Why is that important? Simple, insurance fraud accounts for almost $6 billion(Rs. 529 billion) losses for the insurance industry in India, that is about 8.5% of the total industry revenue. This directly leads to an increase in the annual premium payment of an honest insurance policy holders.

This project deals with building a model that uses GenAI and Machine Learning concepts to predict if an insurance claim is fraud or not.

## Problem Statement

#### Date - 11th September 2025

Develop a platform using Python to analyze and detect fraudulent insurance claims using open-source datasets and historical claim data. Build a web application with FastAPI, apply machine learning models for fraud detection, and assess risk levels. Implement threading for efficient data processing and integrate PostgreSQL for data management. (e.g., improvisations can be made in feature engineering, incorporating external risk factors, and applying responsible AI concepts for ethical decision-making.)

### Objectives:

Collect, preprocess, and enrich insurance claim data using Python libraries and APIs.
Apply machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for fraud detection and risk assessment.
Implement feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
Develop a web application with FastAPI, featuring interactive dashboards using Plotly or Bokeh.
Integrate PostgreSQL for storing claim data and risk assessments, utilizing threading for efficient data processing tasks.

### GenAI Objective: Use GenAI to extract and process information from unstructured data sources.

## Project Development Log

#### I have decided to use a parallel method of completing this project. I will be working on building the model and frontend/ backend development parallely.
