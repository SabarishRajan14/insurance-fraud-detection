# Insurance Claim Fraud Detection
**Problem Statement:**
Develop a platform using Python to analyze and detect fraudulent insurance claims using open-source datasets and historical claim data. Build a web application with FastAPI, apply machine learning models for fraud detection, and assess risk levels. Implement threading for efficient data processing and integrate PostgreSQL for data management. (e.g., improvisations can be made in feature engineering, incorporating external risk factors, and applying responsible AI concepts for ethical decision-making.)
 
**Objectives:**
1. Collect, preprocess, and enrich insurance claim data using Python libraries and APIs.
2. Apply machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for fraud detection and risk assessment.
3. Implement feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
4. Develop a web application with FastAPI, featuring interactive dashboards using Plotly or Bokeh.
5. Integrate PostgreSQL for storing claim data and risk assessments, utilizing threading for efficient data processing tasks.

**GenAI Objective:** Use GenAI to extract and process information from unstructured data sources.
